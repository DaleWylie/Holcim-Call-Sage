# **App Name**: Holcim Call Sage

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Review Generation: Generates a non-biased review of the call transcript based on the defined scoring matrix, extracts the analyst's name, and provides actionable areas for improvement, acting as an assistant tool for quality management.
- Customizable Scoring Matrix Input: Allows users to define a scoring matrix in JSON format, providing a structured way to evaluate call transcripts. This tool uses the provided criteria to rate the support staff member.
- Call Transcript Input: Provides a text area for inputting call transcripts from platforms like Genesys Cloud, enabling the AI to analyze and review the conversation.
- Review Display: Displays the AI-generated review in a clear, structured format, highlighting scores for each criterion, an overall summary, and actionable areas for improvement. Use judgement when considering its suggestions.
- Loading and Error Handling: Handles loading states and error messages to provide a smooth and informative user experience during review generation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust and efficiency, reflecting Holcim's professional services.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a very desaturated version of the primary hue, to provide a neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: Muted green (#81C784), analogous to the primary color, to highlight key actions and feedback.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif) for a modern yet approachable feel that suits both headings and body text.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent different aspects of the call review process. For example, a document icon for transcript input, a matrix icon for the scoring criteria, and a checkmark for areas of improvement.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout, dividing the app into clear sections for input, review generation, and display of results. Use white space to improve readability and reduce visual clutter.
- Use subtle animations, such as a loading spinner during review generation or a smooth transition when displaying results, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
